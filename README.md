### How to run locally

- Put your `.env` file in the root folder.
  It should look like the `.env.example` file.
  Make sure the `API_URL` does not contain `http` or `https`.
- In the root folder run `npm install` and then run `npm start`.
- Then `cd client` and run `npm install` and then run `npm start`.
- The app should be running now on `localhost:3000` and connected to the api on `localhost:5000`.
